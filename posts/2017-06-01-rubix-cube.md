So, I grew up with the Rubix Cube. I always wanted to figure out how to solve it.

One day, probably about 10 years ago, I read a book on the Rubix Cube. The book didn't explain the Cube; it was a catalog of moves: if you see this pattern, rotate like so and you'll get that pattern. Eventually, I could get the Cube into a solved state by stringing those moves together. It was kind of fun & satisfying at first.

But I didn't solve the Rubix Cube, not in the sense of understanding what the rotations actually did in the mechanical system of the Cube. If you gave me a 4x4 cube instead of a 3x3 cube, I'd be lost because I couldn't generalize.

Now, here's a thing that really makes me sad these days: I feel like a lot of people are handling other people I did that Rubix Cube. No understanding. Just pattern matched triggers for rehearsed responses. Stereotypes mapped to spew from a phrase book.

People have more dimensions than a Rubix Cube, though. So, the patterns are oversimplified, the moves are clumsy, and the expected responses never quite match up. But, there's a lot of investment in having memorized these things. It makes us feel clever. So, folks forge ahead trying to nudge each other into the patterns for which they have the right moves.

Lots of talking past each other & arguing with straw men. Lots of key phrases repeated.
